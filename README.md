## Install
The extension can be installed at https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/anki-time-saver/fonjadincmgmiijefljgkiabphnecdnp

## Goal
This extension was made to allow Anki users to create cards faster without having to open the app to input card data.

## ⚠️Things to consider
**This extension was tested with the version 23 of Anki, and will not work with any other versions. This is subject to change.**

**You need to have Anki running to be able to use the extension. Should you not have the required anki setup to use the extension, an error message will be displayed in the window.**

## Current Version
The current version is **1.1.0** (last updated on 20 June 2024)

## Current Status
This is the first version of the app and it's still very primitive. I'm planning to add more features in the future.
